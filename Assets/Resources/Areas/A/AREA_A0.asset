  title: The Briefing
  description: "June 26th, 2022 3:21am\r\n\r\nDriving up to the scene you can hear
    the Sergeant on his bullhorn yelling something indistinguishable from inside
    the car. It is a particularly cold night and the road is still slick with the
    night\u2019s rain.\r\n\r\nThe crime scene dances blue and red with flashing police
    lights. You see a SWAT team ready to storm the building. Stepping out of the
    vehicle the Sergeant\u2019s words become clear.\r\n\r\n\u201C<i>MR. PARKS, IF
    ANY OF THOSE HOSTAGES ARE HARMED THINGS WON\u2019T BE GOOD FOR YOU.</i>\u201D\r\n\r\nWalking
    towards a run down warehouse you can\u2019t see the subject from here. As you
    approach the Sergeant, he continues on his bullhorn.\r\n\r\n\u201C<i>WE NEED
    TO KNOW IF THE HOSTAGES ARE UNHARMED.</i>\u201D\r\n\r\n<align=\"center\">[Type
    MORE to continue]</align>\r\n"
