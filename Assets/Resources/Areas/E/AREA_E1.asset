  description: "\u201C<i>Is she coming here?</i>\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201C<i>She is on
    her way. Will you let Ms. Weber go?</i>\u201D\r\n\r\nHesitating for a moment,
    Frank looks up into the sky letting light rain hit his face.\r\n\r\n\u201C<i>Okay.</i>\u201D\r\n\r\nHe
    lets go of Ms. Weber\u2019s arm. A couple of police officers run up to shelter
    Ms. Weber as she flees back behind the police line.\r\n\r\nFrank walks back inside
    calmly. After a few moments he reappears in the doorway. You notice that he is
    unarmed.\r\n\r\n\u201C<i>Thank you Frank.</i>\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201C<i>I just want
    to talk with my wife.</i>\u201D\r\n\n<align=\"center\">[Type MORE to continue]</align>\n\n"
