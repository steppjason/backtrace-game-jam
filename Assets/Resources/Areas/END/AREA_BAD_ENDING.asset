  title: Conclusion
  description: 'Just as you are about to stop all the commotion and begin communicating
    with Mr. Parks again, you hear a single gunshot ringing inside the warehouse.


    You
    can''t tell if Frank has harmed any of the hostages. All you can hear is screaming
    from inside.


    S.W.A.T. begins to rush past you towards the building with
    weapons drawn. Everything is chaos.
